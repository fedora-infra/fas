"FAS is designed around an open architecture.  Unlike the traditional account "

"group is given at least one administrator who can then approve other people "
"in the group.  Also, unlike traditional account systems.  FAS allows people "
"to apply for the groups they want to be in.  This paridigm is interesting as "

"openness is brought over from the same philosophies that make Open Source "

"and get to know someone in the group.  Find someone with sponsor or admin "
"access and ask them if they'd have time to mentor you.  Plan on spending at "
"least a few days learning about the group, doing a mundane task, "
