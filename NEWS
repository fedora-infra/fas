------
0.8.11
------
* Added feature to allow for email address or username at login (Ian Cole)
* JSON API: If the "/fpca/reject" method encounters an error talking to the 
  database the error is now categorized as DBAPIError instead of
  sqlalchemy.SQLError. python-fedora should not be calling this method. 
  (Adam M. Dutko) 
* fas/configs.py: set() now returns DBAPIError instead of SQLError on database
  save error. (Adam M. Dutko)
* Implement the audio captcha, gives access to an audio file 'speaking' the
  content of the captcha. (Pierre-Yves Chibon)

------
0.8.10
------
* Update user template to show "Invalid" if a password field is '!!'
  (which means that an administrator has removed the password otherwise
  it would be a password hash).
* Update home template so that resetpass link works whether or not the URL of
  the home page had a trailing slash.
* Bugfix: When a user reset their password via the forgot password page, the
  check for whether the user was changing to the current password was broken.
  Fixed so that the current password is not allowed as the new password.

-------
0.8.9.1
-------
* **Important fix** The new password strength checking code was letting users
  set empty passwords.  This release fixes it.

.. warning::

    The 0.8.9 release includes a validator for password strength checking.
    This validator was not run if the user did not enter a password.  This
    allowed users to enter blank passwords.  If you ran the password strength
    checking code either from the brief time when the 0.8.9 release was
    available or from snapshots of the code, you should check that none of your
    users set empty passwords.
