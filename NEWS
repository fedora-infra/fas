:Date: 07 Mar 2013
:Version: 0.8.16

------
0.8.17 (not yet released)
------

* Fix a fpca signing bug

------
0.8.16
------

* Emit some more fedmsg events when changes occur to a user's account
* Fix fedmsg messages using nested dicts -- use the toplevel if there's only a
  single value to be more compatible with the data returned from other services.
* Fix traceback in selinux when creating homedirs in fasClient
* Fix 500's error from group edit if no group_type has been set.
* Fix changing a user's email address before the address is verified
* Remove a case where openid login can result in being logged in as someone
  else.  This unfortunately breaks yadis but we're going to move to having
  openid functionality in a second application so this is a stop gap until that
  is deployed https://github.com/fedora-infra/fas-openid
* Show security question's status from user/view's page.

------
0.8.15
------
* Update translations

---------
0.8.14.91
---------
* Add a patch from ctria (see infra #3027) for checking passwords against
  libpwquality. (Ricky Elrod)

---------
0.8.14.90
---------
* Show the content of the group if there are less than 10 people in
  it. (Pierre-Yves Chibon)

  (Patrick Uiterwijk)

------
0.8.14
------
* Added Security questions, with encrypted answers (Patrick Uiterwijk).

------
0.8.13
------
* Added fedmsg message publishing hooks (Ralph Bean).

------
0.8.12
------
* Added human name check requested in ticket #654. Modified regular expression
  to not only check for missing section of full name (last or first), but avoid
  potential false positives from users entering a middle initial.
  (Fraser S. Gutteridge)

------
0.8.11
------
* Added feature to allow for email address or username at login (Ian Cole)
* JSON API: If the "/fpca/reject" method encounters an error talking to the 
  database the error is now categorized as DBAPIError instead of
  sqlalchemy.SQLError. python-fedora should not be calling this method. 
  (Adam M. Dutko) 
* fas/configs.py: set() now returns DBAPIError instead of SQLError on database
  save error. (Adam M. Dutko)
* Implement the audio captcha, gives access to an audio file 'speaking' the
  content of the captcha. (Pierre-Yves Chibon)

------
0.8.10
------
* Update user template to show "Invalid" if a password field is '!!'
  (which means that an administrator has removed the password otherwise
  it would be a password hash).
* Update home template so that resetpass link works whether or not the URL of
  the home page had a trailing slash.
* Bugfix: When a user reset their password via the forgot password page, the
  check for whether the user was changing to the current password was broken.
  Fixed so that the current password is not allowed as the new password.

-------
0.8.9.1
-------
* **Important fix** The new password strength checking code was letting users
  set empty passwords.  This release fixes it.

.. warning::

    The 0.8.9 release includes a validator for password strength checking.
    This validator was not run if the user did not enter a password.  This
    allowed users to enter blank passwords.  If you ran the password strength
    checking code either from the brief time when the 0.8.9 release was
    available or from snapshots of the code, you should check that none of your
    users set empty passwords.

-----
