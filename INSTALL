This file provides a guideline to new developers hacking on the Fedora Account System and administrators attempting to install the Fedora Account System. It is not yet complete.

------------------
Installation Steps
------------------

Step One: Install Required Packages
===================================

As a privileged user on a Fedora system run the following:

  yum install git-core postgresql-plpython postgresql-server postgresql-python \
  python-TurboMail TurboGears pygpgme python-sqlalchemy python-genshi \
  python-psycopg2 pytz python-babel babel python-GeoIP python-openid \
  python-fedora-turbogears python-migrate python-memcached python-tgcaptcha2 \
  pyOpenSSL gettext python-imaging python-pwquality tulrich-tuffy-fonts

NOTE: Please see the HACKING file located in the same directory as this file for caveats specific to various Fedora and RedHat Enterprise Linux releases.

Step Two: Setup the Database
============================

As a privileged user on a Fedora system run the following:

  su - postgres
  service postgresql initdb

  NOTE: Please read the HACKING file for exceptions to this step for
        newer versions of Fedora with systemd.

As a privileged user on other systems such as RHEL run the following:
  
  su - postgres
  /etc/init.d/postgresql initdb

Step Three: Adjust Postgresql Connection Settings
=================================================

As a privileged user on a Fedora system modify the pg_hba.conf file:

  NOTE: Please read the HACKING file for exceptions to this step for
        newer versions of Fedora.

  vi /var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf

  ADJUST THE CONTENTS AT THE BOTTOM OF THE FILE TO MATCH THE FOLLOWING -->

  # TYPE  DATABASE    USER        CIDR-ADDRESS          METHOD

  # "local" is for Unix domain socket connections only
  local   all         all                               ident sameuser
  # IPv4 local connections:
  #host    all         all         127.0.0.1/32          ident sameuser
  # IPv6 local connections:
  #host    all         all         ::1/128               ident sameuser

  host all all 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 md5
  host all all ::1/128         md5

  #EOF

If you need to make other modifications to postgresql please make them now.

Step Four: Start Postgresql
===========================

As a privileged user on a Fedora system run the following:

  service postgresql start

  OR

  sudo systemctl start postgresql.service

As a privileged user on other systems such as RHEL run the following:
  
  /etc/init.d/postgresql start 

Step Five: Generate Required Files
==================================

As the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  python setup.py egg_info && python setup.py build

This step will regenerate files generated by the build script, setup.py. These files are stored in the fas.egg-info directory in your local clone of the fas module. This directory contains metadata about the program and enables components such as the identity provider to work.

Step Six: Setup a Database User for FAS
=========================================

As the postgres user run the following (be sure to remember your password):

  createuser --encrypted --pwprompt fedora
  ** enter the password twice **
  ** setup the user as a superuser ** NOTE: Is this correct?

Step Seven: Setup plpython for FAS
=======================================

As the postgres user run the following:

  createlang plpythonu template1

Step Eight: Setup the Schema
============================

As the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  cp fas2.sql /tmp

Then change to the postgres user and issue the data definition statements by running the following:

  su - postgres (or sudo su - postgres)
  psql < /tmp/fas2.sql
  exit

Then as the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  rm -f /tmp/fas2.sql

Step Nine: Apply Schema Modifications (NOT NECESSARY FOR FRESH INSTALL)
=======================================================================

If you are updating your version to 0.8.12, you will need to upgrade the database schema.
As the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  cp updates/fas2-0.8.11_to_0.8.12.sql /tmp

Then change to the postgres user and issue the data definition statements by running the following:

  su - postgres (or sudo su - postgres)
  psql < /tmp/fas2-0.8.11_to_0.8.12.sql
  exit

Then as the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  rm -f /tmp/fas2-0.8.11_to_0.8.12.sql


Step Ten: Customize the Configuration File
==========================================

As the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  cp fas.cfg.sample fas.cfg

Once the sample file is copied to your local configuration file adjust the following parameters to suit your needs:

  mail.on # Set to True if you want to test notifications
  mail.smtp.server # adjust the host as needed
  sqlalchemy.dburi # adjust the password for the postgres FAS host and user
  server.socket_port # change if you want to run on a different port
  base_url_filter.base_url # adjust the port and host as needed
  fas.url # adjust the port and host as needed
  key_securityquestion # adjust the key used to encrypt the security answers

You may also need to change some of the directories and settings in fas/config/app.cfg.

Step Eleven: Adjust your Firewall
=================================

Remember to adjust your firewall to allow TCP traffic through your port of choice configured in Step #10.

Step Twelve: Start FAS
======================

As the user you are using for development run the following from within the fresh fas clone:

  ./start-fas

Navigate to the URL you set for fas.url to test the installation works. The default administrative user is "admin" with password "admin". Then create a user to make sure that function works. As a reminder, using localhost.localdomain in your e-mail address is valid.

Another handy command for trying short snippets of code is tg-admin shell.
Make sure you're in the top level directory that start-fas.py and dev.cfg is
in, then run:
  
  tg-admin shell
