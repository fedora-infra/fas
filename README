Upgrading
---------

0.8.7 => 0.8.8
==============
We still haven't worked out using migrate scripts on our database servers so
the changes here need to be done like this:

  sudo -u postgres psql fas2 < updates/fas2-0.8.7_to_0.8.8.sql

0.8.5 => future
===============

From 0.8.5 and onward we will be using SQLAlchemy Migrate to handle database
upgrades.  To use it, it assumes you have already installed fas2.sql into your
posgresql database. The instructions for installing SQLAlchemy-Migrate on top
can be found below in the installation instructions.  

sqlalchemy-migrate will need to be installed.  To do so, run:

 sudo yum -y install python-migrate

(Since I don't trust this yet,  the latest change will need to add:
+    invite_only BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
to the groups table.  There is a migrate script checked in.  Need to verify
that it works and that we'll do that.)

0.8.4 => 0.8.5
==============

When upgrading to 0.8.5 the database schema changed slightly.  The configs
table now has a unique constraint to prevent duplicates being entered.  Use
this to update your existing schema::

  sudo -u postgres psql fas2 < updates/fas2-0.8.4_to_0.8.5.sql

0.8.3 => 0.8.4
==============

When upgrading from 0.8.3 to 0.8.4 there are some new database changes:

  :groups.url: URL where others can look for information about the group
  :groups.mailing_list: Specify a mailing list address that others can use to
  	contact the group
  :groups.mailing_list_url: A url where others can look at list archives and
  	sign up
  :groups.irc_network: IRC network on which the IRC channel is
  :groups.irc_channel: IRC channel where communication with the group occurs
  :people.country_code: Two digit country code for where the user is from
  :user_group: View that allows mod_auth_pgsql to work with the db
  :session: Table for doing OpenID sessions.

You can add these to your database by running the sql commands in
``updates/fas2-0.8.3_to_0.8.4.sql`` like this::

  sudo -u postgres psql fas2 < updates/fas2-0.8.3_to_0.8.4.sql

The country code functionality also makes use of python-GeoIP.  This should
be installed as a dependency if you use the fas rpms.  Otherwise you need to
install that manually::

  sudo yum -y install python-GeoIP
